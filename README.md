**FullStack CRUD Application**

A simple full-stack web application that demonstrates basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations. The backend is built with Spring Boot and exposes RESTful APIs, while the frontend is a React app that consumes those APIs. Data is stored in a relational SQL database, and Postman can be used to test each endpoint.
